## Task Estimates

### FE Tasks

| # | Task | Complexity Score | Size | Risk | Notes |
|---|------|-----------------|------|------|-------|
| FE-1 | [description] | [7-35] | [S/M/L] | [Low/Med/High] | [rationale] |
| FE-2 | [description] | [7-35] | [S/M/L] | [Low/Med/High] | [rationale] |

**FE Total:** [sum] days (risk-adjusted: [adjusted] days)

### BE Tasks

| # | Task | Complexity Score | Size | Risk | Notes |
|---|------|-----------------|------|------|-------|
| BE-1 | [description] | [7-35] | [S/M/L] | [Low/Med/High] | [rationale] |
| BE-2 | [description] | [7-35] | [S/M/L] | [Low/Med/High] | [rationale] |

**BE Total:** [sum] days (risk-adjusted: [adjusted] days)

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| [risk 1] | [+N% effort] | [H/M/L] | [strategy] |
| [risk 2] | [+N% effort] | [H/M/L] | [strategy] |

**Risk Multiplier:** [1.0x / 1.3x / 1.5x / 2.0x]

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **FE Effort** | [N] days |
| **BE Effort** | [N] days |
| **Total (raw)** | [N] days |
| **Total (risk-adjusted)** | [N] days |
| **Critical Path** | [longest dependency chain] |
| **FE/BE Ratio** | [FE%] / [BE%] |

## Flags

- ⚠️ [XL tasks that need breakdown]
- ⚠️ [High-risk items needing `/makeit:clarify`]
- ⚠️ [Dependencies that could cause delays]
