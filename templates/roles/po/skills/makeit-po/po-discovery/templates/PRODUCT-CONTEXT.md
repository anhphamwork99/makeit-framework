## Product Overview

<!-- PO focus: product features, user-facing behavior, business domain -->
<!-- Minimize technical depth — PO needs product context, not code details -->

### Product Name & Purpose
<!-- One-line product description and primary value proposition -->

### Target Users
<!-- Who uses this product? User segments, personas -->

## Existing Features

<!-- Features already shipped and working — PO needs to know what exists to avoid duplication -->

| Feature | Status | User Impact | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| {feature-1} | {active/deprecated/beta} | {high/medium/low} | {any relevant notes} |
| {feature-2} | {active/deprecated/beta} | {high/medium/low} | {notes} |

## User Journeys

<!-- Key user flows — understanding existing flows helps PO define new goals that integrate well -->

### Primary Flow
<!-- The main user journey through the product -->

### Secondary Flows
<!-- Important alternative paths users take -->

## Business Context

<!-- Business metrics, KPIs, and strategic context PO needs for decision-making -->

### Key Metrics
<!-- KPIs, analytics, tracking in place -->

| Metric | Current Value | Target | Source |
|--------|--------------|--------|--------|
| {metric-1} | {value or "N/A"} | {target} | {analytics tool} |

### Revenue/Growth Context
<!-- Business model, growth levers, monetization strategy if relevant -->

### Competitive Landscape
<!-- Key competitors, differentiators, market position -->

## Product Architecture (High-Level)

<!-- Simplified architecture — PO needs to understand system boundaries, not implementation -->

### System Components
<!-- Major system parts that affect product decisions -->

| Component | Purpose | User-Facing? |
|-----------|---------|:---:|
| {component-1} | {what it does for users} | ✅/❌ |
| {component-2} | {what it does for users} | ✅/❌ |

### Integration Points
<!-- External services, APIs, third-party tools that affect product behavior -->

## Design System (If Applicable)

<!-- Design patterns and conventions PO should be aware of when creating backlog items -->

- **Figma:** {link to design system if exists}
- **Key Patterns:** {recurring UI patterns — lists, cards, forms, etc.}
- **Brand Guidelines:** {link or brief summary}

## Sprint-Relevant Context

<!-- Observations specific to current sprint scope -->
<!-- What existing product features/patterns should this sprint build on or be aware of? -->

### Related Features
<!-- Existing features that relate to current sprint goals -->

### Known Pain Points
<!-- User feedback, bug reports, or UX issues relevant to sprint goals -->

### Technical Constraints (PO-Level)
<!-- Constraints that affect product decisions — NOT code-level details -->
<!-- Example: "API rate limits affect real-time features", "Mobile app requires offline support" -->

## Notes for This Sprint

<!-- Any additional product context that affects PO decision-making -->
