## Product Context

<!-- BA primary focus — existing features, user journeys, business logic -->

### Existing Features

<!-- Features already shipped and working — affects story scope and AC references -->

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [Feature 1] | [What it does — user-facing behavior] | [Active/Deprecated/In progress] |
| [Feature 2] | [Description] | [Status] |

### User Journeys

<!-- Key user flows already documented or discoverable in previous deliverables -->

- [Journey 1 — e.g., "User registration → email verification → profile setup"]
- [Journey 2 — e.g., "Product search → add to cart → checkout"]

### Business Metrics

<!-- KPIs, analytics, tracking already in place — relevant for story AC -->

- [Metric 1 — e.g., "Conversion rate tracked via Mixpanel"]
- [Metric 2 — e.g., "Session duration via analytics"]

## Design System Components

<!-- UI components available for Figma analysis reference -->

| Component | Type | Variants | Used In |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|
| [Component] | [Button/Input/Card/Modal/etc.] | [Variants available] | [Features using it] |
| [Component] | [Type] | [Variants] | [Features] |

## Existing Stories & Patterns

<!-- Story format conventions and AC patterns from previous sprints -->

| Sprint | Story Count | AC Pattern | Notable Conventions |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| [SPRINT-001] | [N stories] | [e.g., Given/When/Then] | [e.g., Always include error state AC] |

**Common AC patterns observed:**
- [Pattern 1 — e.g., "Every form story includes validation AC"]
- [Pattern 2 — e.g., "API-dependent stories include loading/error states"]

## Notes for This Sprint

<!-- Relevant observations specific to current sprint scope -->
<!-- What existing patterns should stories reference or be aware of? -->

- [Observation 1 — e.g., "Existing auth flow uses JWT, new feature should be consistent"]
- [Observation 2 — e.g., "Similar feature exists in module X, check for reuse"]
